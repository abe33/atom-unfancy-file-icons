# unfancy-file-icons package

My file icons stylesheets as a package

![Screenshot](https://github.com/abe33/atom-unfancy-file-icons/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

- Use only icons from Octicons (shipped with Atom)
- Use a simple color code (with a few exceptions when it make more sense, like for ruby files) which works as follow:
  - green for source files
  - yellow for template and stylesheet files
  - cyan for documentation files (markdown, latex, pdf, etc.)
  - blue for media files (images, videos, art software files, etc.)
  - violet for data files (json, yml, csv, etc.)
  - magenta for configuration files (.gitignore, .ruby-version, etc.) and scripts
- Use generic icons rather than trying to find one for each file extension (except when an icon in Octicons fit the file, like with ruby files)
